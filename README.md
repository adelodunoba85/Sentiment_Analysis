# Sentiment_Analysis

The Python BeautifulSoup library was utilized to extract data from the British Airways review page: [https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways]. Subsequently, the initial 1000 customer reviews were gathered and subjected to Natural Language Processing analysis using NLTK tools. To enhance the quality of the text data, noisy elements like stopwords, punctuation, white spaces, and special characters were meticulously eliminated. Furthermore, text normalization techniques, such as stemming, were applied, along with other essential text cleaning procedures.

Following the data preparation phase, sentiment analysis was conducted on the statements, categorizing them into three distinct groups: positive, negative, and neutral. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the sentiments expressed in the reviews, a visualization was generated, highlighting the most frequently mentioned words. It is important to note that the outcome of this project will vary for different individuals exploring it, as customer reviews on the website are continuously updated.
